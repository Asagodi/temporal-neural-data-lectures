  abstract = "We analyse the convergence properties of three spike-triggered
              data analysis techniques. Our results are obtained in the setting
              of a probabilistic linear-nonlinear (LN) cascade neural encoding
              model; this model has recently become popular in the study of the
              neural coding of natural signals. We start by giving exact
              rate-of-convergence results for the common spike-triggered
              average technique. Next, we analyse a spike-triggered covariance
              method, variants of which have been recently exploited
              successfully by Bialek, Simoncelli and colleagues. Unfortunately,
              the conditions that guarantee that these two estimators will
              converge to the correct parameters are typically not satisfied by
              natural signal data. Therefore, we introduce an estimator for the
              LN model parameters which is designed to converge under general
              conditions to the correct model. We derive the rate of
              convergence of this estimator, provide an algorithm for its
              computation and demonstrate its application to simulated data as
              well as physiological data from the primary motor cortex of awake
              behaving monkeys. We also give lower bounds on the convergence
              rate of any possible LN estimator. Our results should prove
              useful in the study of the neural coding of high-dimensional
              natural signals.",

  abstract  = "Statistical dependencies in the responses of sensory neurons
               govern both the amount of stimulus information conveyed and the
               means by which downstream neurons can extract it. Although a
               variety of measurements indicate the existence of such
               dependencies1, 2, 3, their origin and importance for neural
               coding are poorly understood. Here we analyse the functional
               significance of correlated firing in a complete population of
               macaque parasol retinal ganglion cells using a model of
               multi-neuron spike responses4, 5. The model, with parameters fit
               directly to physiological data, simultaneously captures both the
               stimulus dependence and detailed spatio-temporal correlations in
               population responses, and provides two insights into the
               structure of the neural code. First, neural encoding at the
               population level is less noisy than one would expect from the
               variability of individual neurons: spike times are more precise,
               and can be predicted more accurately when the spiking of
               neighbouring neurons is taken into account. Second, correlations
               provide additional sensory information: optimal, model-based
               decoding that exploits the response correlation structure
               extracts 20\% more information about the visual scene than
               decoding under the assumption of independence, and preserves
               40\% more visual information than optimal linear decoding6. This
               model-based approach reveals the role of correlated activity in
               the retinal coding of visual stimuli, and provides a general
               framework for understanding the importance of correlated
               activity in populations of neurons.",
